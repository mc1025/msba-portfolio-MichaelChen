What would be implemented in 1–2 sentences?
- Incentives that reward current users when they have successively invited family/friends to switch to our network
- Include personalized rewards and offers that encourage users to actively refer friends/family
What is the success metric, and what is the baseline customer churn percentage or value from your data? At the same time, what is one metric you would not want to get worse?
- Reduction in churn rate & new customers who came through referral
- Baseline customer churn percentage is ~27%
- churn rate. We do not want the churn rate to go up.
How would you measure impact, and what are two risks or unintended consequences? Measurement examples are an A/B test or phased rollout etc.
- We would run a randomized A/B test where our treatment group would be the ones who receive customized referrals, and a control group that just has the normal experience
- Some risks would involve users only giving referrals for the incentives, which would seem to increase customerbase short term, but not be able to retain them in the long run.
- Another risk is the upfront cost. If the number of referrals doesn't retain customers, the company ends up losing money.
