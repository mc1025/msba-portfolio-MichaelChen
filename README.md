Portfolio for projects at my MSBA program at UofL
Business Problem: The central business problem TruSource is facing is customer satisfaction. High churn reduces recurring revenue stability, increases acquisition costs, and weakens brand loyalty. When customers leave, the company not only loses current revenue but also forfeits future lifetime value and potential referral opportunities. 
Key Results: 
- Strengthen Referral Programs 
- Reduce Billing Friction for Electronic Check Customers
- Promote Long-Term Contracts

Code explanation:
- import code (pandas,numpy, etc, that are necessary for data processing)
- read dataset (retentiondata_case.csv)
- explore data using (head, shape, describe), check data for any issues
- cleaning data by deleting or updating the data (feature engineering, splitting data into training and testing sets), preps the data for machine learning
- build a model to predict outcome by going through patterns in the dataset

Limitation:
- The model relies on historical data and may not capture future behavioral shifts. 
- External factors such as competitor promotions or regional outages were not included. 
- Some behavioral motivations behind churn cannot be observed directly in structured data.
